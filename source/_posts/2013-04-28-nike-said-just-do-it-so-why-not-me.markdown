Just Do It.  Nike coined this slogan in 1988 and today it is still iconic.  Today represents my Just Do It moment as I write my initial blog post.  Neglected Bytes represent the digital collection of thoughts, project ideas and tutorials.

I welcome you to my blog; I hope that you find something useful as I carve out my digital landscape.

Happy Reading!
